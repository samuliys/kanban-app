Progress Log - Samuli Yli-Salom√§ki 909509

Report 1: Start-16.3.
I have added classes for the main kanban app (Kanban) and its main components Board, Column and Card.
These have basic functionality and support adding, removing and editing new cards, columns and boards.
Archive and tag system have also been implemented and former supports archiving cards and returning cards from archive
and the latter adding and deleting tags and adding and removing them from cards and filtering based on tags.
Object Main for the GUI has been added. It handles main aspects of the GUI
and is responsible for displaying instances of the classes mentioned above.
GUI supports the main functionality of the main classes and also moving cards and filtering based on tags.

The main methods of the classes have been tested so that they work.
I am constantly testing the GUI (and that also tests the methods of the classes).
The GUI has the most bugs and needs the most testing and while the biggeset bugs have been fixed
there are likely still some scenarios I haven't tested. 

My main problem was moving the cards. Originally I tried to implement it by dragging
but I didn't manage to get the elements to recognise the end of a drag that was started inside a different element.
I changed it so that moving is done by first clicking a card so that it is active
and then clicking a space between the cards as the target location.
At first I also had difficulty in getting aspects of the GUI update when a new card was added for example.
I fixed this by making the creation of some GUI elements to methods and calling them again after a change was made and that fixed it.

I have spent quite a lot of hours on the project. Approximately 30 hours have been spent so far.

Currently I am ahead of schedule. I have managed to implement many features that were supposed to be implemented later in the project plan.

-----
Instructions:
1-3 lines description of what classes have been added or updated and what functionality have been implemented in them (even if they were not ready yet).
What methods / functionality have been tested so far in classes so that they work properly?
What possibly difficult errors have occurred and have they been resolved?
What has been the workload used during this time with some 5 hours accuracy.
Whether you are ahead or lagging behind what you presented in the project plan (roughly at this phase).
